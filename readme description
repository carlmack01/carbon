●	Used multiple regression analyses of carbon emissions data from US states and compared to prices on emissions, outdoor recreation, and population. 
We found that there were minor correlations between the price placed on carbon emissions and the decreasing of emissions themselves.  It was also found
that states that value outdoor recreation had a smaller level of carbon emissions as well.  For population, there was little relationship shown.
